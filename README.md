# Agent Girl Copywriting Agents

Stop reading like a Vegas dealer shuffles cards.

This is the copywriting agent system that writes like a human, thinks like a psychologist, and positions like Sabri Suby on espresso.

Not another AI wrapper that spits out corporate slop.

Not another "content tool" that makes you sound like a LinkedIn bot having an identity crisis.

This is 8 specialized agents that produce copy so authentic, your audience will think you hired a ghostwriter who actually gets them.


## What This Is (And Why You Should Care)

Most AI copywriting tools are a joke.

They give you the same recycled garbage everyone else is posting.

They sound like a TED Talk had a baby with a motivational poster.

They produce "content" that gets scroll fatigue in 0.3 seconds.

This system is different.

It's built on master copywriter frameworks from Sabri Suby, Dan Kennedy, Gary Halbert, and Chief Neefe.

It understands psychological triggers like a therapist understands childhood trauma.

It writes variations that actually test differently because they use fundamentally different persuasion architectures.

Think of it like having Gordon Ramsay's entire kitchen brigade working on your social media.

Except instead of risotto, they're crafting hooks that stop thumbs mid scroll.


## The 8 Agents (Your New Strike Team)

**Master Orchestrator**: Routes briefs like a 911 dispatcher on Red Bull. Asks the right questions when you give half baked inputs.

**Research Agent**: Crawls the web for swipe files and validates sources. No hallucinations. No "trust me bro" references.

**Persona Research Agent**: Builds audience profiles so detailed you'll feel like you're reading their therapy notes. Pain points, aspirations, exact language they use, terminology that makes them cringe.

**Copywriter Analysis Agent**: Extracts techniques from master copywriters. Breaks down why Sabri's positioning crush works. Why Dan Kennedy's deadline scarcity terrorizes procrastinators. Why Gary Halbert's story hooks feel like talking to an old friend.

**Headlines & Hooks Specialist**: Generates psychology based hooks using 9 core triggers. Curiosity, specificity, identity, contrast, relevance, scarcity, authority, emotion, pattern interrupt. Calibrated by intensity. No conflicts.

**Social Media Copy Writer**: Writes 3 to 5 variations of native ads and organic posts. Each variation uses a different master framework. Chief Neefe contrast loops. Gary Halbert story hooks. Dan Kennedy problem agitation solution stacks. Sabri Suby leverage positioning.

**Video Script Writer**: Short form scripts for TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts. First 3 seconds stop the scroll or you're dead. Pattern interrupts that force attention. Emotional arcs that build to action.

**Quality Review Agent**: Self evaluates against 4 quality gates before you ever see the copy. Authenticity score. Psychological trigger alignment. Persona match. Variation distinctiveness. If it doesn't pass, it doesn't ship.


## What You Actually Get

Copy that doesn't sound like AI wrote it.

No excessive dashes pretending to be dramatic pauses.

No corporate buzzwords like "leverage synergies" or "revolutionize your workflow."

Contractions that feel natural.

Sentence variety that sounds like a real human talking.

Specific examples and numbers that build credibility.

Personality and voice that matches your brand.

Passive voice under 10 percent because we're not writing a research paper.


## The Knowledge Base (Your Unfair Advantage)

**Copywriter Technique Playbooks**: Sabri Suby's leverage positioning. Dan Kennedy's hard deadline scarcity. Gary Halbert's benefit focused storytelling. Chief Neefe's contrast loops and agitation through repetition. Extracted, analyzed, templated.

**Psychological Frameworks**: 9 core triggers with intensity scales, conflict matrices, copy type recommendations. You'll know exactly which triggers work for organic posts versus native ads versus video scripts. You'll know which combinations feel manipulative and which feel persuasive.

**Quality Checklists**: 10 comprehensive evaluation frameworks. Authenticity tests. Trigger alignment scoring. Persona match verification. Variation distinctiveness checks. The same gates the Quality Review Agent uses.

**Swipe Files**: Curated examples from real campaigns. Social media ads that crushed. Sales pages that converted. Video scripts that went viral. Organized by trigger type and copy structure.


## Why This Matters (The Real Problem)

You've probably noticed that most "AI generated content" gets ignored.

There's a reason for that.

It's because AI tools write for algorithms, not humans.

They optimize for keywords, not psychology.

They produce volume, not impact.

The result?

You post 5 times a day and get engagement from bots and your mom.

You run ads that get impressions but zero clicks.

You write scripts that people scroll past in 0.8 seconds.

Meanwhile, the people who understand persuasion psychology are crushing it with half the output.

They write less.

They test smarter.

They use frameworks that have worked for 40 years because human psychology hasn't changed.

This agent system gives you those frameworks.

Not watered down.

Not "inspired by."

The actual techniques, extracted and executable.


## How To Use It (Stupidly Simple)

This system is built for the Minimal Claude approach.

That means you can run it in Claude Desktop, Claude API, or any environment that supports Claude Sonnet 4.5.

No complex setup.

No 47 step installation process.

No Docker containers pretending to be necessary.

Here's the flow:

**Step 1**: Submit a brief. Product, audience, goal. Can be detailed or rough. The Orchestrator will ask follow up questions if needed.

**Step 2**: Research agents run in parallel. Web research for swipe files. Persona research for audience insights. Copywriter analysis for technique matching.

**Step 3**: Headlines and hooks get generated. Psychology based. Trigger calibrated. Ready to test.

**Step 4**: Copy writers produce 3 to 5 variations. Each uses a different master framework. Each could perform differently in real world testing because the underlying persuasion architecture is fundamentally different.

**Step 5**: Quality Review Agent evaluates everything. Scores each variation against 4 quality gates. Flags anything that fails. You only see copy that passes.

**Step 6**: You review, pick winners, provide feedback. The system learns for next time.


## The Tech (For People Who Care)

8 specialized agents.

Each has a distinct system prompt, knowledge base access, and quality checklist.

All outputs are versioned in Git.

If an agent breaks or produces bad copy, you can revert to a stable version in 30 seconds.

No starting over from scratch.

No "we lost everything" disasters.

The knowledge base is modular.

You can add new copywriter techniques.

You can update psychological frameworks.

You can expand swipe files.

Everything is markdown.

Everything is readable.

Everything is forkable.


## Who Built This And Why

This was built as a contribution to Agent Girl, the agent framework created by Ken Kai.

Agent Girl makes building AI agents stupidly simple.

No frameworks.

No orchestration layers.

Just markdown prompts, knowledge bases, and Claude doing what Claude does best.

This copywriting agent system is our way of giving back to that community.

We believe the best tools get built when people share what works.

We believe open source wins when quality rises for everyone.

We believe you shouldn't have to pay $297 per month for AI copy that sounds like a robot wrote it during a firmware update.

So here it is.

8 agents.

Complete knowledge base.

Master copywriter frameworks.

Psychological trigger library.

Quality checklists.

All open.

All forkable.

All ready to use.


## What's Ready Right Now

All 8 agent prompts built and tested.

Complete knowledge base with 4 master copywriter playbooks.

Psychological frameworks covering 9 core triggers with intensity scales and conflict matrices.

Quality checklists for all 4 evaluation gates.

Repository structure with Git versioning.

Documentation for system architecture and data flow.

Everything you need to run this today.


## What's Next (Let's Build This Together)

We're in Phase 4 now.

That means testing with real briefs.

Running 10, 20, 50 copy requests through the system.

Collecting feedback on what works and what doesn't.

Identifying patterns in performance across different audiences and offers.

Refining agent prompts based on real world results.

Building the feedback loop so the system learns from every brief.

You can help.

Clone this repo.

Test it with your copy briefs.

Break it.

Find edge cases.

Contribute improvements.

Share what works.

The system gets better when more people use it and report back.

That's how open source works.

That's how we build tools that actually solve real problems instead of generating hype decks for VC pitch meetings.


## How To Get Started

**Step 1**: Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-girl-copywriting-agents.git
```

**Step 2**: Review the agent prompts in the `/agents/` directory. Each agent has a complete system prompt with instructions, quality gates, and output formats.

**Step 3**: Check out the knowledge base in `/knowledge-base/`. Read the copywriter technique playbooks. Study the psychological frameworks. Review the quality checklists.

**Step 4**: Set up your Claude environment. This works with Claude Desktop, Claude API, or any Minimal Claude setup. Just point the agents at their prompts and knowledge bases.

**Step 5**: Run a test brief. Start simple. Product description, target audience, goal. Let the Orchestrator route the workflow.

**Step 6**: Review the output. Score the variations. Provide feedback. See what the Quality Review Agent caught and what it missed.

**Step 7**: Iterate. Test with different briefs. Different audiences. Different offers. Find the patterns.

**Step 8**: Contribute back. Open issues. Submit pull requests. Share what worked. Help make this better for everyone.

## Quality Standards (Non Negotiable)

No AI sounding language.

No excessive dashes pretending to be thoughtful pauses.

No corporate tone that sounds like a LinkedIn influencer having an existential crisis.

Psychological triggers embedded and calibrated by intensity.

Natural conversational tone.

3 to 5 meaningful variations that use different persuasion frameworks.

Self evaluated against quality gates before human review.

If it doesn't pass the authenticity test, it doesn't ship.


## The Feedback Loop (How This Gets Better)

Agents generate copy and self evaluate against checklists.

You review and score the variations.

Feedback gets stored in `/copy-outputs/[brief-id]/feedback/`.

Agents reference feedback patterns for future briefs.

Full version history in Git means rollback is always available.

The system learns.

The quality improves.

The copy gets sharper.


## Credits And Community

Let's build tools that actually help people instead of adding to the pile of AI slop that's terrorizing the internet.


## Final Word

This isn't a product.

It's a tool.

It's open source because we believe the best systems get built when people collaborate instead of gatekeep.

It's modular because we know you'll want to customize it for your specific needs.

It's versioned in Git because we're not savages who lose work when things break.

Clone it.

Test it.

Break it.

Fix it.

Make it better.

Then share what you learned so the next person doesn't have to start from scratch.

That's how we win.

Not by hoarding techniques.

Not by charging $997 for a course that could have been a Google Doc.

But by building tools that solve real problems and sharing them with people who will actually use them.

Let's go.
