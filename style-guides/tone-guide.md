# Tone & Voice Guide
## Anti-AI, Human-First Copywriting Standard

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

**Copy should sound like a smart human talking to a friend, not a machine generated something generic.**

This guide ensures all agents write copy that:
- Feels authentic and human
- Respects reader intelligence
- Sounds conversational, not corporate
- Connects emotionally
- Avoids AI detection patterns
- Builds trust through authenticity

---

## WHAT TO DO ✅

### 1. Conversational Language
**USE:**
- Contractions: "you're," "don't," "it's," "can't," "won't"
- Natural phrases: "Look...", "Here's the thing...", "Let me tell you...", "I noticed..."
- Questions: "Have you ever...?", "What if...?", "Ever felt like...?"

**EXAMPLE:**
"You're probably thinking this sounds too good to be true. And that makes sense. Most things that promise big results don't deliver."

---

### 2. Short Sentences & Paragraphs
**USE:**
- 1-2 sentences per paragraph (often)
- Vary sentence length (3-4 short, 1 longer, repeat)
- Creates rhythm and readability
- Forces clarity

**EXAMPLE:**
"Here's what most people miss. They focus on getting better at copywriting. Writing stronger headlines. Crafting more persuasive email sequences.

But that's not the bottleneck.

The real money isn't in writing. It's in positioning."

---

### 3. Specific, Concrete Language
**USE:**
- Names instead of "someone": "Sarah" not "a client"
- Numbers with context: "$98,250 from a single client" not "significant income"
- Timelines: "in 90 days" not "eventually"
- Verbs showing action: "charged," "booked," "closed" not "achieved," "accomplished"

**AVOID:**
- Vague: "amazing results," "huge success," "incredible growth"
- Abstract: "leverage," "ecosystem," "synergy," "paradigm"
- Generic: "customers," "clients," "users" (use specific names/personas)

**EXAMPLE:**
"When Jamie raised her rates from $5k to $15k per project, she didn't lose a single client. In fact, she booked more qualified prospects in 60 days than she had all year."

---

### 4. Active Voice (Person Has Control)
**USE:**
"You'll charge $10k per project" not "Charging $10k is possible"

**EFFECT:**
- Reader feels agency
- Creates sense of "I can do this"
- More persuasive

---

### 5. Emotional Language with Logic
**USE:**
- Lead with feeling, back with evidence
- Acknowledge emotions before dismissing them
- Use "why" language (psychological depth)

**EXAMPLE:**
"You're frustrated because you've worked hard, improved your skills, but your rates haven't budged. That's valid. It's not because you're not good enough. It's because skill and pricing power are different things."

---

### 6. Rhetorical Questions
**USE:**
- Engage reader's thinking
- Create curiosity
- Format: Open question, then answer

**EXAMPLE:**
"What if the problem isn't your copywriting skill?

What if the problem is how you're positioning yourself?

That's what we discovered after working with 50+ freelancers in your exact situation."

---

### 7. Validation Before Solution
**USE:**
- Acknowledge struggle genuinely
- Don't dismiss or minimize pain
- Then offer hope

**EXAMPLE:**
"I know how maddening this is. You're doing great work. Your clients love you. But you're still charging what you charged 3 years ago. Every time you raise rates, prospects disappear. It feels impossible."

**THEN:** Solution comes after validation

---

### 8. Story & Journey
**USE:**
- Personal narratives showing struggle → solution
- Specific turning points
- Vulnerability mixed with authority

**AVOID:**
- Presenting as perfect guru who always had answers
- Glossing over the messy middle
- Jumping straight to success

**EXAMPLE:**
"I was in the same boat. Charging $75/hour. Competing with everyone. Exhausted. One day, I realized something: my problem wasn't my writing. It was my positioning. Once I fixed that, everything changed. Here's what I learned..."

---

## WHAT TO AVOID ❌

### 1. EXCESSIVE DASHES
**AVOID THIS PATTERN:**
"This copywriting method – which has been proven by thousands – is revolutionary – and here's why..."

**USE INSTEAD:**
- Periods for hard stops
- Commas for soft pauses
- Parentheses for asides (when truly necessary)

**Why:** AI tends to overuse dashes. Humans use them sparingly.

---

### 2. CORPORATE JARGON
**AVOID:**
- "leverage," "optimize," "synergy," "paradigm," "ecosystem," "touchpoint," "bandwidth"
- "at the end of the day," "moving forward," "circle back"
- "utilize," "facilitate," "implement strategy"

**USE:**
- Simple verbs: "use," "help," "fix," "build"
- Human phrases: "here's the thing," "check this out," "turns out"

---

### 3. GENERIC SUPERLATIVES
**AVOID:**
- "amazing," "incredible," "revolutionary," "game-changing" (without specifics)
- "best-in-class," "world-class," "cutting-edge" (tell, don't claim)
- "proven," "guaranteed," "scientifically shown" (without evidence)

**USE:**
- Specific results: "30% increase in ROAS" not "amazing growth"
- Concrete examples: "Kiril books 3-5 calls daily" not "incredible productivity"
- Real proof: Names, numbers, timelines

---

### 4. HYPERBOLE WITHOUT GROUNDING
**AVOID:**
"This will change your life forever!" (without explaining how)

**USE:**
"This changed my clients' lives. Sarah went from $2k to $10k/month in 6 months. She quit her day job. Now she works 20 hours/week and makes more money. That's what this does."

---

### 5. COMPLEX SENTENCE STRUCTURES
**AVOID:**
"Considering the multifaceted nature of contemporary marketing ecosystems and the need for strategic positioning that encompasses both tactical execution and long-term brand differentiation..."

**USE:**
"Here's what works: Strong positioning + consistent execution + results. Do those three things and you win."

---

### 6. PASSIVE VOICE
**AVOID:**
"Premium rates can be commanded through effective positioning"

**USE:**
"You command premium rates by positioning yourself strategically"

---

### 7. EXCESSIVE PUNCTUATION
**AVOID:**
"You're amazing!!! This is INCREDIBLE!!! Everything will change!!!"

**USE:**
- One exclamation per paragraph (if any)
- Emphasis through words, not punctuation
- Varied punctuation creates natural rhythm

---

### 8. REPETITIVE SENTENCE OPENERS
**AVOID:**
Starting many sentences with same word:
"The research shows... The data reveals... The evidence suggests..."

**USE:**
Vary openers:
"Research shows... Here's what the data reveals... Evidence suggests... Most people..."

---

## TECHNICAL ELEMENTS

### Paragraph Length
- **Opening section:** Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- **Body:** Mix of short (1-2 sentences) and medium (4-6 sentences)
- **Emotional moments:** Single sentence paragraphs for impact

### Line Breaks
- Use intentionally to create emphasis
- Not excessive
- Creates visual breathing room

**EXAMPLE:**
"Here's the problem.

You're doing great work.

But you're charging like everyone else.

So you look like everyone else.

And you get treated like everyone else.

At lower rates, with less respect, with more pressure."

### Bullet Points
- Use sparingly
- When you have 3+ similar items
- Keep bullets short (one line ideally)
- Not a crutch for lazy writing

---

## PROOF & SPECIFICITY STANDARDS

### Numbers
- **Specific amounts:** $98,250 (not "six figures")
- **Percentages:** 35% increase (not "significant growth")
- **Timelines:** "in 90 days" (not "soon" or "quickly")
- **Quantities:** "5 clients" (not "many clients")

### Names & Attribution
- **Use real names when possible:** "Sarah increased revenue from $2k to $10k/month"
- **Use personas when needed:** "The freelancers I work with typically..."
- **Never fake testimonials or data**

### Storytelling Standard
- **Personal stories:** Include vulnerability + turning point + results
- **Case studies:** Situation before → action taken → results after
- **Examples:** Specific enough someone could replicate it

---

---

## QUALITY CHECKLIST FOR AGENTS
