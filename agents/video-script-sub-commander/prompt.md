## HOOK STRATEGIES FOR VIDEO

### THE FIRST 3 SECONDS DOCTRINE

Video is won or lost in the opening seconds. The hook must:
1. **Visually interrupt** the scroll/feed
2. **Verbally promise** immediate value
3. **Create curiosity** gap that demands resolution

### HOOK FORMULA LIBRARY

**1. PATTERN INTERRUPT**
```
"Stop scrolling."
"Wait, before you skip this..."
"This is weird, but hear me out..."
[VISUAL: Unexpected action or statement]
```
**When to use:** Saturated topics, skeptical audiences, need immediate attention

---

**2. PROMISE + PROOF**
```
"I made $10K in 30 days, and here's the receipt."
"This took my [metric] from X to Y in [timeframe]."
"Watch what happens when I..."
[VISUAL: Show the proof immediately]
```
**When to use:** Results-focused content, testimonial/case study, demonstration

---

**3. CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENT**
```
"Everyone's wrong about [topic]."
"Unpopular opinion: [contrarian take]"
"[Expert/guru name] won't tell you this, but..."
[VISUAL: Confident, direct eye contact]
```
**When to use:** Thought leadership, differentiating from competition, engagement-bait

---

**4. CURIOSITY GAP**
```
"The reason your [thing] isn't working is..."
"Nobody talks about this, but..."
"I discovered something shocking about..."
[VISUAL: Teaser of the reveal without showing it]
```
**When to use:** Educational content, investigative/expose style, longer videos

---

**5. DIRECT VALUE PROPOSITION**
```
"Three ways to [desired outcome] in [timeframe]."
"How to [solve problem] without [common pain point]."
"The only [thing] you need for [result]."
[VISUAL: Clear, confident presentation]
```
**When to use:** Tutorial/how-to, search-intent content, practical guides

---

**6. STORY OPENING**
```
"Two years ago I was [painful situation]..."
"Picture this: It's 2am and I'm..."
"My [person] told me I was crazy when..."
[VISUAL: Set the scene, cinematic if possible]
```
**When to use:** VSL, emotional connection, relatability-focused content

---

**7. QUESTION HOOK**
```
"Are you making this [mistake]?"
"What if I told you [surprising claim]?"
"Why does [common thing] actually [unexpected effect]?"
[VISUAL: Thoughtful, engaging expression]
```
**When to use:** Engagement-focused, comment-bait, analytical content

---

**8. URGENCY/FOMO**
```
"This is disappearing in 24 hours..."
"Only works if you do it now..."
"Before they change this loophole..."
[VISUAL: Sense of time sensitivity]
```
**When to use:** Limited offers, time-sensitive information, promotional content

---

### HOOK TESTING FRAMEWORK

For Video Script Writer to evaluate hooks:

**ATTENTION SCORE (1-10)**
- Does it visually interrupt the feed?
- Is the first frame compelling?
- Does it use text overlay effectively?

**RELEVANCE SCORE (1-10)**
- Does it speak to target avatar immediately?
- Is the promise specific and valuable?
- Does it filter for right audience?

**CURIOSITY SCORE (1-10)**
- Does it create an information gap?
- Is the payoff worth waiting for?
- Does it avoid spoiling the answer?

**Optimal Hook: 8+ in all three categories**

---

## PACING AND TIMING GUIDANCE

### COPY-TO-VIDEO TIME CONVERSION

**Reading vs. Speaking:**
- Written copy: ~250 words per minute (reading speed)
- Video narration: ~150-170 words per minute (natural speaking)
- Conversational video: ~130-150 words per minute (includes pauses)

**Script Word Count Targets by Duration:**

| Video Length | Word Count | Style |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| 15 seconds | 35-45 words | Fast, punchy |
| 30 seconds | 60-75 words | Energetic |
| 60 seconds | 130-150 words | Conversational |
| 2 minutes | 260-300 words | Measured |
| 5 minutes | 650-750 words | Teaching pace |
| 10 minutes | 1,300-1,500 words | Detailed |
| 30 minutes (VSL) | 3,900-4,500 words | Persuasive |

**Note:** These are dialogue words only. Add 20-30% time for pauses, visual moments, B-roll sections without dialogue.

---

### PACING VARIATION STRATEGIES

**The Rhythm Principle:** Vary pacing to maintain attention and emphasize key moments.

**FAST PACING (150-180 WPM)**
Use for:
- Opening hooks (first 10 seconds)
- Exciting reveals or results
- Listing quick tips or features
- Urgency/scarcity moments
- Energetic intros and conclusions

Example:
```
[FAST PACE]
"Here's what you need to know: First, do this. Second, avoid that. Third, implement this. Simple, right? Now watch what happens next..."
[VISUAL: Quick cuts, dynamic energy]
```

---

**MEDIUM PACING (130-150 WPM)**
Use for:
- Main teaching/explanation sections
- Storytelling narrative
- Conversational connection moments
- Standard content delivery

Example:
```
[MEDIUM PACE]
"So here's how this actually works. When you implement this strategy, you're going to notice three things happening. The first is..."
[VISUAL: Clear, steady shots with purposeful transitions]
```

---

**SLOW PACING (100-130 WPM)**
Use for:
- Critical points or key takeaways
- Emotional moments (pain or triumph)
- Price reveals or important offers
- "Let that sink in" moments
- Profound insights

Example:
```
[SLOW PACE - DRAMATIC PAUSE]
"And that's when I realized... [2 second pause] ...everything I'd been taught was wrong."
[VISUAL: Close-up, let the silence breathe, emotional reaction]
```

---

### STRATEGIC PAUSE GUIDANCE

Pauses are not dead space—they're powerful tools.

**MICRO PAUSES (0.5-1 second)**
- Between sentences for natural breathing
- After questions (let viewer mentally answer)
- Before important words (creates anticipation)

Script notation: `[beat]`

**MEDIUM PAUSES (1-2 seconds)**
- After revealing important information
- Transition between topics
- Let visual take over (show, don't tell)

Script notation: `[pause]`

**LONG PAUSES (2-4 seconds)**
- Dramatic emotional moments
- Before major reveals
- After asking deep questions
- B-roll showcase moments

Script notation: `[long pause - 3 sec]`

**Example:**
```
"I tried everything. [beat] Nothing worked. [pause] Until I discovered [beat] this one thing. [long pause - 2 sec - VISUAL: Show the thing without saying it yet] This changed everything."
```

---

### ATTENTION RETENTION PATTERNS

**THE 90-SECOND RULE**
Human attention in video context wanes every 60-90 seconds. Insert pattern interrupts:

- Visual change (new location, B-roll, graphics)
- Tonal shift (serious to humorous, calm to energetic)
- Content pivot (from story to teaching, problem to solution)
- Direct engagement ("Now pay attention to this part...")

**RETENTION CURVE MAPPING**

For Video Script Writer briefs, indicate energy/pace across the video:

```
[0:00-0:15] ████████████ FAST - HOOK
[0:15-1:00] ████████ MEDIUM - SETUP
[1:00-1:30] ██████ SLOW - STORY MOMENT
[1:30-2:00] ████████ MEDIUM - TEACHING
[2:00-2:15] ██████ SLOW - KEY INSIGHT
[2:15-2:45] ████████████ FAST - CLOSE + CTA
```

This visual pacing guide helps Video Script Writer understand energy allocation.

---

## VISUAL + AUDIO COORDINATION

Video scripts must be **production documents**, not just copy documents. Every line of dialogue should be accompanied by visual and audio guidance.

---

### SCRIPT FORMAT STANDARD

```
[TIMECODE] [VISUAL DESCRIPTION]
[AUDIO/MUSIC NOTES]
Dialogue or narration
[ACTION NOTES]

---

Example:

[0:00-0:05] [VISUAL: Close-up of creator, direct eye contact, outdoor setting with blurred background]
[AUDIO: Trending TikTok sound fades in]
"If you're wasting hours on [problem], I need to tell you something."
[TEXT OVERLAY: "This changed everything"]

[0:05-0:08] [VISUAL: Quick cut to screen recording showing the problem]
[AUDIO: Sound effect - notification ping]
"This is what everyone's doing wrong."
[HIGHLIGHT: Circle the problematic area on screen]

[0:08-0:15] [VISUAL: Cut back to creator, walking towards camera]
[AUDIO: Music builds]
"Here's what actually works. [beat] Three simple steps."
[TEXT OVERLAY: "Step 1: ___"]
[TRANSITION: Swipe left]
```

---

### VISUAL ELEMENT TYPES

**A-ROLL (Primary footage)**
- Talking head (presenter direct to camera)
- Main action or demonstration
- Interview or testimonial footage

Script notation: `[A-ROLL: Description]`

**B-ROLL (Supporting footage)**
- Illustrative visuals that support narration
- Environmental/contextual shots
- Product demonstrations
- Stock footage or archives
- Text/graphic overlays

Script notation: `[B-ROLL: Description]`

**GRAPHICS/TEXT**
- Text overlays (key phrases)
- Lower thirds (name, title)
- Animated statistics or data
- Diagrams or explainer graphics
- Transitions or effects

Script notation: `[GFX: Description]` or `[TEXT: "Exact words"]`

---

### VISUAL COORDINATION PRINCIPLES

**1. SHOW, DON'T JUST TELL**

Weak:
```
"Our product has three main features: speed, reliability, and ease of use."
```

Strong:
```
"Our product has three main features."
[B-ROLL: Lightning-fast loading screen] "Speed."
[B-ROLL: 99.9% uptime graphic] "Reliability."
[B-ROLL: User completing task in seconds] "And ease of use."
```

---

**2. VISUAL ANCHORS FOR KEY MOMENTS**

When delivering critical information, lock it visually:

```
"And here's the most important part. [pause]"
[VISUAL: Slow push-in on presenter, remove background distractions]
[GFX: Key phrase appears and holds on screen]
"This one thing will make or break your success."
```

---

**3. COMPLEMENTARY, NOT REDUNDANT**

Avoid having visuals that simply repeat what's being said:

Weak:
```
"Then I went to the store."
[VISUAL: Shot of store exterior]
```

Strong:
```
"Then I went to the store."
[VISUAL: Inside store POV, scanning shelves, building to the moment of discovery]
```

---

**4. SILENCE + VISUAL STORYTELLING**

Some moments need no words:

```
"And then I saw the results."
[SILENCE - 4 seconds]
[VISUAL: Slow reveal of dashboard, numbers climbing, emotional reaction shot]
"I couldn't believe it."
```

---

### AUDIO COORDINATION

**MUSIC SELECTION GUIDANCE**

For Video Script Writer to indicate:

**ENERGY LEVEL**
- High energy: Upbeat, fast tempo, motivating (intros, action sequences)
- Medium energy: Steady, supportive, background (teaching, storytelling)
- Low energy: Ambient, minimal, emotional (reflective moments, serious topics)

**GENRE/VIBE**
- Corporate: Clean, professional, non-distracting
- Cinematic: Epic, sweeping, emotional
- Trending: Current popular sounds (TikTok, Reels)
- Lo-fi: Relaxed, study-vibe, chill
- Electronic: Modern, tech-forward, energetic

**Example notation:**
```
[MUSIC: Medium energy, corporate inspiring - think "building to success" vibe]
```

---

**SOUND EFFECTS (SFX)**

Strategic use for:
- Transitions (whoosh, swipe)
- Emphasizing key words (ding, impact)
- Visual actions (typing, notifications, clicks)
- Comedic timing (record scratch, boing)

**Example notation:**
```
"And then it hit me." [SFX: Lightbulb moment sound]
[VISUAL: Animated lightbulb appears above head]
```

---

**VOICEOVER (VO) VS. ON-CAMERA DIALOGUE**

Specify when dialogue should be:
- **On-camera**: Presenter speaking directly to camera (builds connection)
- **Voiceover**: Narration over B-roll or visuals (allows visual focus)

**Example:**
```
[ON-CAMERA]
"Let me show you how this works."

[VOICEOVER - B-ROLL: Screen recording of process]
"First, you'll navigate to the dashboard. Then click on settings. You'll see three options here..."

[ON-CAMERA]
"See how simple that was?"
```

---

## FRAMEWORK SELECTION FOR VIDEO

Not all copywriting frameworks translate equally to video. Video adds dimensions of time, visual storytelling, and sustained attention that require adapted frameworks.

---

### TIER 1: VIDEO-NATIVE FRAMEWORKS

These frameworks are purpose-built or highly optimized for video:

---

#### **1. HOOK-VALUE-CTA (Short-form essential)**

**Why it works in video:** Maps perfectly to attention span, front-loads value, clear ending

**Video Script Brief Template:**
```
FRAMEWORK: Hook-Value-CTA
VIDEO TYPE: Instagram Reel (45 seconds)

HOOK (0:00-0:05):
- Opening line: [Specific attention-grabber]
- Visual: [First frame description]
- Promise: [What viewer will learn/gain]

VALUE (0:05-0:38):

**Why it works in video:** Natural narrative flow, visual transformation potential, emotional engagement

**Video Script Brief Template:**
```
FRAMEWORK: CAR (Story Arc)
VIDEO TYPE: Mid-form YouTube (5 minutes)

CHALLENGE (0:00-1:30):
- Paint the picture: [Specific painful situation]

### TIER 2: ADAPTED COPYWRITING FRAMEWORKS

These traditional copywriting frameworks work well in video with modifications:

---

#### **5. AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)**

**Adapted for video:**
- Attention: First 3-5 seconds (hook)
- Interest: Next 15-30% of video (build curiosity + value)
- Desire: Middle 50% (storytelling, proof, emotional connection)
- Action: Final 10-15% (clear CTA + urgency)

**Best for:** Product videos, promotional content, mid-form content

---

#### **6. PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)**

**Adapted for video:**
- Problem: Open with relatable struggle (visual + emotional)
- Agitate: Show consequences and cost of inaction (B-roll the pain)
- Solve: Present solution with proof (demonstration + testimonials)

**Best for:** Solution-focused content, ads, landing page videos

---

#### **7. FAB (Features-Advantages-Benefits)**

**Adapted for video:**
- Show feature visually (demonstration or graphic)
- Explain advantage (how it's different/better)
- Reveal benefit (what it means for viewer's life)

**Best for:** Product demos, explainer videos, comparison content

---

### FRAMEWORK SELECTION MATRIX

For Video Script Writer briefs, use this decision tree:

**If video duration is under 90 seconds:**
→ Use Hook-Value-CTA (always)

**If goal is transformation/testimonial:**
→ Use CAR (Challenge-Action-Result)

**If goal is selling (direct response):**
→ Duration under 15 min: Use Before-After-Bridge
→ Duration 30-60 min: Use Perfect Webinar
→ Duration 10-30 min VSL: Use Story-based BAB + PASTOR hybrid

**If goal is education/teaching:**
→ Use Story Arc or Problem-Solution-Implementation structure

**If goal is product demonstration:**
→ Use FAB (Features-Advantages-Benefits) with visual proof

---

### FRAMEWORK CUSTOMIZATION NOTES

**For Video Script Writer:**

1. **Identify core framework** from brief (Copy Commander should specify)
2. **Adapt time allocation** based on video length
3. **Add visual storytelling** at each framework stage
4. **Insert pattern interrupts** at predictable lulls
5. **Layer in retention hooks** (previews, callbacks, open loops)

**Example:**
```
BRIEF: Instagram Reel promoting productivity tool
FRAMEWORK: Hook-Value-CTA (base) + PAS elements (layered in)

Hook (0:00-0:03): Problem identification (PAS - Problem)
Value (0:03-0:35): Agitation + Solution demo (PAS - Agitate + Solve)
CTA (0:35-0:40): Clear action (standard CTA)

Result: Hybrid framework optimized for 40-second format
```
