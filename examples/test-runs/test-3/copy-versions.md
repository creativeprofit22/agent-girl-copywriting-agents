### STRATEGY NOTES

- **Hook Strategy:** Direct validation ("You deserve this") stops scroll better than asking questions
- **Pain Recognition:** "50k followers but barely any income" hits exactly—Casey's audience sees themselves
- **Guilt Reversal:** "That's broken" + "your audience would support you" reverses Casey's guilt about asking

### BEST FOR
