# TEST BRIEF 1: Social Media Post
## Persona: Alex (Freelancer/Service Provider)
**Date:** November 11, 2025
**Status:** Active Test

---

## BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Objective
Create 3 distinct Instagram/TikTok posts that position freelancers (specifically copywriters, designers, developers) as premium service providers who can command higher rates.

### Target Persona
**Alex** - The Ambitious Freelancer
- Age: 28-38
- Current situation: Charging $75-150/hour or $1k-5k per project
- Pain point: Rate ceiling, trapped in commodity pricing, sees others charging 3-5x their rate
- Aspiration: Command $10k+ per project, work with premium clients
- Platform: Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn

### Copy Type
Native advertising social posts (blend-in, doesn't scream "ad")

### Desired Outcome
Post should:
1. **Hook** Alex's frustration (recognize themselves in the problem)
2. **Agitate** the pain (show cost of staying at current rates)
3. **Position** the solution (hint at positioning-based rate increase)
4. **CTA** - Soft CTA (follow, DM, check bio, etc.)

## RESEARCH CONTEXT

### Persona Language
- "I want to charge premium rates but..."
- "How do I differentiate myself?"
- "Everyone else figured it out"
- "I'm undervalued in my niche"

### Psychological Triggers to Deploy
- **Curiosity Gap:** "What if your problem isn't your skill?"
- **Social Proof:** "Other freelancers are getting $10k+ - here's how"
- **Loss Aversion:** "Every day at current rates = money lost"
- **Status/Identity:** "From commodity vendor to strategic partner"

### Frameworks to Consider
- **CAR** (Curiosity-Agitation-Resolution)
- **BAB** (Before-After-Bridge)
- **PAS** (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

### Tone Requirements
- Conversational, peer-to-peer
- No corporate jargon, no excessive dashes
- Specific (numbers, examples, named people)
- Relatable vulnerability mixed with expertise

## SPECIFICATIONS

### Platform Details
- **Primary:** Instagram (with hook for saves/shares)
- **Secondary:** TikTok (if adapted for vertical video copy)
- **Format:** Carousel or single-image caption OR short video script

### Length
- Instagram caption: 200-400 words (scannable, line breaks strategic)
- TikTok: If adapted, 15-30 second script format

### Native Ad Requirements
- Must NOT feel like promotional content
- Should feel like genuine insight/experience sharing
- Should blend with organic content feed
- Educational/entertainment first, selling second
