- **KPIs:** Click-through rate (3-6%), cost per lead ($5-15)
- **Timeline:** Immediate deployment
- **Urgency:** High (new niche, zero existing data)

- **Psychographics:** Wants passive income, scared of being on camera, skeptical of online courses
- **Buyer Stage:** Awareness → Consideration (needs education + proof)

### Key Pain Points Identified

2. **Secondary:** "I don't have time/skills"
3. **Tertiary:** "Is this really passive?"
4. **Trust:** "I've tried online business before, nothing worked"
5. **Barrier:** "I don't have equipment or know-how"

### Data Requirements

## STRATEGIC PLANNING DECISION

### Framework Selection
**Primary Framework:** PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution) with Multi-Angle Approach
**Rationale:** Facebook audience for this demographic is skeptical, wants proof, needs specific data. PAS + multiple psychological angles ensures comprehensive objection coverage.

### Approach Strategy
- **Multi-Version Strategy:** 5 distinct psychological angles (not variations of same angle)
- **Angle 1:** Privacy + Income Relief
- **Angle 2:** AI Automation (ease)
- **Angle 3:** Beginner Confidence (permission-giving)
- **Angle 4:** Niche-Specific Data (logic/credibility)
- **Angle 5:** Personal Story (vulnerability/trust)

### Research Orchestration
**Coordinating with Research Agent:**
- ✅ Market research: Faceless YouTube growth trends
- ✅ Audience research: Demographic + psychographic analysis
- ✅ Competitor analysis: Existing course positioning gaps
- ✅ Psychology research: Facebook ad effectiveness for this persona
- ✅ Data verification: Income potential, CPM rates, timelines

## RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS

**Research Agent has been coordinated to gather:**

1. **Market Research**
   - Faceless YouTube growth rates (0-100K in 9 months possible?)
   - Current course landscape (competitors, messaging gaps)
   - Income potential ranges ($12k-$120k/year realistic?)

2. **Audience Research**
   - Who buys these courses? (demographics, psychographics)
   - What are the exact pain points? (primary + secondary fears)
   - What's missing in competitor messaging?

3. **Monetization Research**
   - YouTube CPM rates by niche (gaming vs finance vs tech)
   - Realistic income timelines (how long to 4K hours + 1K subs?)
   - Best niches for CPM (which pay highest?)

4. **Facebook Psychology Research**
   - What angles convert for skeptical Facebook audiences?
   - How do older/skeptical audiences respond to course ads?

## STRATEGIC NOTES FOR SUB-COMMANDER

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Differentiation:** Each ad must take a DIFFERENT psychological angle (not just variations)
2. **Research Integration:** Specific numbers (CPM, growth rates) must feel natural (not forced)
3. **Objection Coverage:** All 5 ads together should cover primary + secondary objections completely
4. **Authenticity:** Alex must feel like ads are written by someone who "gets it" (peer, not guru)
5. **Proof Hierarchy:** Ad 1-3 build permission, Ad 4 builds logic, Ad 5 builds emotional trust

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- ❌ Generic "make money online" language
- ❌ Overpromising (30-day results, easy money)
- ❌ Tone shifts between versions (all must be peer-level)
- ❌ Showing off (humility required)
- ❌ Missing specificity (vague timelines, vague income)
