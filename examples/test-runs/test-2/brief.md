# TEST BRIEF 2: LANDING PAGE
## Persona: Jamie (E-Commerce/Small Business Owner)
**Date:** November 11, 2025
**Status:** Active Test

---

## BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Objective
Create 3 distinct long-form landing pages targeting e-commerce store owners/small business owners struggling with rising customer acquisition costs (CAC), declining ROAS, and margin compression.

### Target Persona
**Jamie** - The Growth-Hungry E-Commerce/Small Business Owner
- Age: 32-45
- Current revenue: $150k-$500k/year
- Pain point: CAC rising, ROAS declining, margins shrinking, can't scale without quality drop
- Aspiration: $1M+ revenue, healthy margins, sustainable growth, systems that don't depend on Jamie
- Primary concern: "My business is profitable, but I'm stuck on a plateau"

### Copy Type
Long-form sales page (Chief Neefe structure + Dan Kennedy framework)

### Desired Outcome
Page should:
1. **Hook** Jamie's frustration (recognize their specific situation)
2. **Establish Authority** (show you understand e-commerce challenges)
3. **Present Solution** (positioning/systems/strategy shift, not just tactics)
4. **Provide Proof** (case studies, numbers, results)
5. **Remove Risk** (guarantee, clear implementation path)
6. **Drive Action** (clear CTA, urgency)

## RESEARCH CONTEXT

### Persona Language
- "CAC is killing us"
- "Margins are getting tighter"

### Psychological Triggers to Deploy

- **Authority:** "I've helped 40+ stores scale from $300k to $1m+"
- **Social Proof:** "Stores like yours are doing X, here's how"
- **Status/Leverage:** "From ad-dependent to sustainable business"

### Frameworks to Consider
- **Star-Story-Solution** (Chief Neefe style)
- **Four Ps** (Promise-Picture-Proof-Push)
- **PAS** (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

### Tone Requirements
- Respect intelligence (Jamie is experienced business owner)
- Data-driven (specific numbers, ROI calculations)
- Strategic (not just tactics, but systems)
- Direct (no bullshit, get to the point)
