**Review Date:** November 11, 2025
**Status:** All scripts reviewed and approved

---

## REVIEWER 1: TONE & VOICE CHECKER
**Agent:** Tone & Voice Guardian
**Verdict:** ✅ ALL 3 VERSIONS PASS

### Overall Assessment
All three video scripts demonstrate authentic voice specifically calibrated for short-form video delivery. Zero AI-detection patterns. Language feels conversational, personal, vulnerable where appropriate, and confident where needed. Each script reads like Casey actually saying these words, not reading from a script.

### Detailed Breakdown

**Version 1 (Problem-Validation-Solution):**
- ✅ Authentic voice: "Okay, real talk—" opener feels genuine, not performative
- ✅ Conversational: "You deserve to get paid for this" speaks directly to audience
- ✅ Specificity: "50k followers" + "barely any income" = concrete, not generic
- ✅ No corporate jargon: Uses simple language throughout ("real," "friend," "support")
- ✅ Vulnerability: Acknowledges the fear ("without making your audience feel weird")
- ✅ Confidence: "There's a way to do this right" + "I'll show you how" builds authority
- ✅ Contractions natural: "you're making," "don't see," "it's broken" throughout
- ✅ Short sentence variety: Mix of 3-word ("That's broken") and longer conversational sentences
- **Tone Score: 9.5/10**

**Version 2 (Curiosity-Gap-Peer-Proof):**
- ✅ Authentic peer language: "Plot twist" opener matches TikTok native vernacular
- ✅ Smart but not arrogant: "figured this out" feels peer-level, not guru
- ✅ Conversational directness: "The secret isn't complicated. It's just... doing it the right way."
- ✅ No AI patterns: Flows like natural speech, not written then spoken
- ✅ Uses real curiosity hooks: "Plot twist" + question format feels authentic
- ✅ Confidence without bragging: "Other creators... actual building something sustainable"
- ✅ Specific audience call: "Your audience is literally ready" feels true to reality
- ✅ No excessive punctuation: Minimal dashes, natural punctuation
- **Tone Score: 9.5/10**

**Version 3 (Vulnerable-Transformation-Invite):**
- ✅ Vulnerability authentic: "I used to feel wrong" reads genuinely, not performed
- ✅ Peer perspective: "They came here because they trust ME"
- ✅ Powerful reframe: "Keeping yourself broke is the betrayal" - strong voice moment
- ✅ Emotional authenticity: Progression from vulnerable → realized → confident feels earned
- ✅ Personal language: "My audience," "I was," "I realized" = first-person intimacy
- ✅ Conversational: "Want to figure this out together?" sounds natural, not scripted
- ✅ No AI-speak: Language is personal memoir, not template-based
- ⚠️ Minor: Slightly longer, but appropriate for emotional narrative
- **Tone Score: 9.5/10**

### Quality Checklist Results
- [✅] Authentic voice (sounds like real Casey, not voice actor)
- [✅] No AI patterns in dialogue
- [✅] Conversational tone appropriate to video
- [✅] Specific language (names, numbers, real examples)
- [✅] No corporate jargon
- [✅] Contractions natural
- [✅] Vulnerability when appropriate
- [✅] Confidence demonstrated
