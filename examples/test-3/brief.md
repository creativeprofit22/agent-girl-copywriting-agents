# TEST BRIEF 3: Video Script
## Persona: Casey (Content Creator/Influencer)
**Date:** November 11, 2025
**Status:** Active Test

---

## BRIEF OVERVIEW

### Objective
Create 3 distinct video scripts (TikTok/YouTube Shorts format) that monetize Casey's audience without compromising authenticity or losing followers.

### Target Persona
**Casey** - The Authentic Content Creator
- Age: 25-35
- Current situation: 50k-150k followers across platforms (Instagram/TikTok/YouTube)
- Income: 0-500/month from current audience (despite massive reach)
- Pain point: Audience loyalty without revenue, fear of platform dependence, "selling out"
- Aspiration: Monetize authentically, build real community, create sustainable income from content
- Platform: TikTok (primary), YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels

### Copy Type
Short-form video scripts (15-60 seconds max)

### Desired Outcome
Script should:
1. **Resonate** with Casey's authentic audience (doesn't feel like selling out)
2. **Acknowledge** the monetization journey (be real about needing income)
3. **Educate** audience about opportunity (not hard-sell pitch)
4. **Create** curiosity for CTA (DM, link, quiz, etc.)
5. **Stay true** to Casey's voice (maintain authentic personality throughout)

## RESEARCH CONTEXT

### Persona Language
- "I have great engagement but make almost nothing"
- "How do I monetize without losing my audience?"
- "I'm afraid if I promote something, people will unfollow"
- "I want to build something real, not just chase trends"
- "My audience trusts me, I don't want to break that"

### Psychological Triggers to Deploy
- **Authenticity/Trust:** "You don't have to fake it"
- **Abundance Mindset:** "Your audience wants to support you"
- **Guilt Reversal:** "You deserve to be paid for your value"
- **Community:** "Real fans become real partners"
- **FOMO (subtle):** "Others are doing this, you could too"

### Frameworks to Consider
- **Hook-Story-Value-CTA** (short-form storytelling)
- **Problem-Validation-Solution** (quick pain → relief)
- **Curiosity-Gap-Bridge** (mysterious → reveal → action)
- **Peer-Validation-Proof** (social proof + relatable example)

### Tone Requirements
- Conversational, peer-to-peer
- Funny/entertaining where appropriate (match Casey's vibe)
- Vulnerable but confident (not desperate)
- Fast-paced but not salesy
- Authentic to platform (TikTok energy)

## SPECIFICATIONS

### Platform Details
- **Primary:** TikTok (15-60 second video format)
- **Secondary:** YouTube Shorts (format-compatible)
- **Tertiary:** Instagram Reels (slight adaptation)

### Length
- Short form: 15-30 seconds (optimal for TikTok algorithm)
- Can extend to 45-60 seconds if necessary for narrative
- Script breakdown: Hook (3 sec) → Body (8-15 sec) → CTA (3-5 sec)

### Video Script Format
- Scene descriptions (what's happening on screen)
- Dialogue (what Casey is saying, spoken word)
- On-screen text (captions, overlays)
- Audio cues (music, sound effects if needed)
- Timing indicators (how long each section lasts)

### Authenticity Requirements
- Must feel like Casey's natural content
- No obvious "sponsored" energy
- Should look like regular content Casey already makes
- CTA should feel organic to the message

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] Hook works for short-form (stops scroll in first 2 seconds)
- [ ] Maintains engagement throughout (no loss of attention mid-video)
- [ ] CTA feels natural (not jarring "buy now" energy)
- [ ] No "salesy" language or tone
- [ ] Audience (Casey's fans) would feel respected, not manipulated

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR VIDEO SCRIPTS

### Casey's Fear of "Selling Out"
- This is THE major objection
- Every script must address this implicitly
- Language that acknowledges audience trust is critical
- Show that monetization = sustainability = more content = win-win

### Platform-Specific Energy
- TikTok is fast, dynamic, entertaining
- Script pacing must match content creation energy
- Can't be too polished (would feel corporate/fake)
- Should feel like Casey just had this thought and is sharing it

### Hook Urgency in Short-Form
- First 2 seconds are critical
- Must stop scroll or video is dead
- Hook options:
  - Surprising statement
  - Relatable problem (Casey's audience faces same issue)
  - Vulnerability moment
  - Curiosity gap

### Visual Possibilities (Notes for Production)
- B-roll of Casey creating content (what audience sees)
- Split screen (Casey talking + audience reaction/comment examples)
- On-screen text (emphasizing key phrases)
- Simple graphics (not overproduced)

## TESTING NOTES

This is the third test of the copywriting factory agents, but first test of VIDEO scripts. Expect:
- Shorter copy = tighter writing required
- Platform-specific optimization (not just generic video)
- Heavy emphasis on authenticity (video shows face/personality)
- Hook must work harder (visual + audio competing with swipes)
- Different pacing rules than long-form

### Success Indicators
- Scripts feel authentic to Casey's style
- No AI-detected patterns (especially important in video where words are even more exposed)
- Multiple distinct angles (not variations of same approach)
- CTA feels natural (not forced)
- Psychological triggers deployed subtly (not manipulative)
