## KEY FINDINGS - TEST BRIEF 2

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **Specific E-Commerce Metrics:** All three versions spoke Jamie's language (CAC, ROAS, LTV, repeat purchase rate, margins). This specificity created immediate credibility.

2. **Problem Validation:** V3's opening ("You're not stupid. Your business is profitable... but something feels wrong") validated Jamie's situation before selling. This is exceptionally effective.

3. **Multi-Dimensional Proof:**
   - V1: Case studies through narrative (story)
   - V2: Mathematical proof (data)
   - V3: Testimonials from real store owners (peer validation)
   All approaches credible, different appeals.

4. **Psychological Layering:** All three deployed multiple psychological triggers simultaneously:
   - Loss aversion (cost of staying stuck)
   - Aspiration/desire (vision of escape)
   - Status/identity shift (from stressed to systematic)
   - Social proof (others have done this)

5. **Long-Form Mastery:** Despite being 2,600-3,000 words, all three maintained engagement through varied pacing, specific examples, and clear structure. No section felt like filler.
