**Subject:** Your CAC problem isn't what you think it is
**Preview:** 40+ store owners got this wrong (until...)

Hi [Name],

I'm going to tell you something that costs most e-commerce store owners thousands in lost profit every single month.

Your CAC problem isn't what you think it is.

Most people look at rising customer acquisition costs and think: "I need better ads. Better landing pages. Better targeting."

I used to think the same thing.

But here's what I discovered after helping 40+ store owners scale from $300k to $800k+:

**The real problem isn't your CAC. It's your business model.**

When I say that, most people immediately push back. "My model is fine. I just need to optimize better."

And yeah, optimizing helps. But it's like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

Here's why:

If your business model depends entirely on constantly acquiring new customers at cheaper costs, you're fighting a losing battle. The math just doesn't work long-term.

But the crazy part? There's a completely different way to build an e-commerce business. A way where:

- CAC actually decreases (even as you scale)
- ROAS goes UP (not down)
- Margins improve (not compress)
- Growth becomes sustainable (not exhausting)

The difference between stores stuck in the hamster wheel and stores growing profitably isn't skill or better marketing.

It's a different business architecture.

And it's learnable.

I'm going to show you exactly what this looks like in the next few emails. But first, I want you to see something specific:

The stores that figured this out went from feeling trapped to feeling in control. Within 90 days.

Not because they suddenly became better marketers. But because they rebuilt their customer economics.

More on that soon.

For now, just know: There's a way out.

—[Your Name]

P.S. — In the next email, I'll show you exactly what the problem is (and why it's not your fault).

### EMAIL 1 - STRATEGY NOTES

- **Hook:** Belief challenge ("isn't what you think") creates immediate curiosity
- **Authority:** "40+ store owners" establishes scale without being arrogant
- **Pain Recognition:** References CAC rising, ROAS declining (Jamie's exact situation)
- **Permission-Giving:** "it's learnable" reduces fear
- **Cliffhanger:** "I'll show you exactly what the problem is" creates open loop
- **Length:** 210 words (scannable, not overwhelming)
- **CTA:** Soft (P.S. creates anticipation for next email)

## EMAIL 2: PAIN AGITATION & VALIDATION
**Subject Line:** "What $200K in lost profit actually costs you"
**Preview Text:** "The number that wakes people up (usually)"
**Send Time:** Day 2 (follow-up)
**Goal:** Open rate 35-42%, deepen emotional connection, validate struggle

### EMAIL 2 - FULL COPY

**From:** [Your Name]
**Subject:** What $200K in lost profit actually costs you
**Preview:** The number that wakes people up (usually)

---

Hey [Name],

Let me be direct about something.

Right now, if your CAC is rising at the rate it's rising for most e-commerce owners (8-12% per quarter), here's what happens in 5 years:

Your CAC more than doubles.

For a store doing $400k revenue today, that means $200k-$500k in lost profit over 5 years.

That's not small money.

But that's just the dollars.

The real cost is bigger:

**In stress:** Every quarter is a sprint. Every month you're wondering if you'll hit numbers. There's no predictability. No peace.

**In opportunity:** While you're optimizing ads and landing pages, other stores are building systems. They're creating repeat customers. They're making real money on the back-end. They're scaling sustainably.

**In business value:** You've built something, but you can't sell it. Because it depends entirely on your constant optimization. No acquirer would pay a multiple for that.

**In quality of life:** You can't delegate properly because you're the expert. You can't take time off without worrying. You're trapped.

Here's what I want you to know:

**This isn't your fault.**

You've done everything right. You've optimized. You've tested. You've hired good people. You've worked hard.

The problem isn't you or your team. The problem is the model.

And the good news? Models can be changed.

The stores I work with who understand this? Within 120 days they:
- Decrease CAC (because they're attracting different customers)
- Increase LTV (because they've built retention systems)
- Improve margins (because of better economics)
- Stop the stress (because growth is predictable)

Not because they're smarter. But because they're building differently.

I'll show you exactly how in the next email.

But for now, just know: You're not broken. Your model is.

And that's actually good news, because models are fixable.

More tomorrow.

—[Your Name]

P.S. — The stores that made this shift all said the same thing: "I can't believe nobody taught us this earlier."

### EMAIL 2 - STRATEGY NOTES

- **Loss Aversion:** $200k-$500k concrete number drives emotional response
- **Validation:** "This isn't your fault" removes shame/guilt
- **Multi-Dimensional Agitation:** Addresses dollars, stress, opportunity, quality of life
- **Permission-Giving:** "Models can be changed" creates hope
- **Evidence:** "Within 120 days" makes it believable (specific timeframe)
- **Length:** 240 words (slightly longer as trust builds)
- **CTA:** "I'll show you exactly how in the next email" = powerful open loop

## EMAIL 3: SOCIAL PROOF & CASE STUDIES
**Subject Line:** "How Marcus scaled to $850K without losing margins"
**Preview Text:** "The story that changes how people think..."
**Send Time:** Day 4 (deep engagement)
**Goal:** Open rate 40-45%, build credibility through proof, address "is this possible?" objection

---

### EMAIL 3 - FULL COPY

**From:** [Your Name]
**Subject:** How Marcus scaled to $850K without losing margins
**Preview:** The story that changes how people think about growth

---

Hi [Name],

Let me tell you about Marcus.

Marcus was running a fitness equipment store doing $420k/year. CAC was rising. ROAS was declining. He was spinning wheels on optimization.

He kept thinking, "If I just get better at Facebook ads, this solves itself."

It didn't.

Then something shifted. He realized:

His business model was broken, not his ads.

So here's what he did:

He stopped optimizing for customer acquisition. He started optimizing for customer lifetime value.

That single shift changed everything.

Instead of: "How do I acquire cheaper customers?"

He asked: "How do I make customers worth more?"

And here's what happened:

He rebuilt his customer journey. Created a digital product complement to his physical products. Developed a retention program that turned one-time buyers into repeat customers.

It took 16 weeks.

**The results:**

- CAC: Stayed at $62 (solved the rising CAC problem)
- LTV: Increased from $180 → $440
- Repeat purchase rate: Went from 35% → 62%
- Sustainable revenue: Now at $850k+ with better margins

Same budget. Better results. More sustainable.

Not because he got better at ads. But because the model works differently.

Here's the thing though:

Marcus isn't unique. I've watched this same transformation happen with:

**Sarah** (supplement store): $280k → $380k, CAC -22%, repeat purchases 18% → 43%

**Jennifer** (beauty brand): $510k → sustainable growth, CAC -31%, repeat rate 12% → 48%

The pattern is consistent. The math works. The results are repeatable.

Because it's not magic. It's a system.

And systems can be learned.

In the next email, I'm going to show you exactly how this system works and why the math is so different from what you're probably doing now.

But for now, see that pattern? All these stores:
- Stopped competing on customer acquisition
- Started competing on customer lifetime value
- Got sustainable growth as a result

That could be you.

More tomorrow.

—[Your Name]

P.S. — Marcus said this when he hit $850k: "I can't believe I was spending $300k trying to optimize my way out of a model problem instead of just changing the model."

## EMAIL 4: SOLUTION FRAMEWORK & RISK REVERSAL
**Subject Line:** "Here's exactly what they did (step-by-step)"
**Preview Text:** "The framework that changed everything..."
**Send Time:** Day 5 (decision-making phase)
**Goal:** Open rate 42-45%, explain system, introduce guarantee

---

### EMAIL 4 - FULL COPY

**From:** [Your Name]
**Subject:** Here's exactly what they did (step-by-step)
**Preview:** The framework that changed everything (and how to apply it)

---

Hi [Name],

Okay, let me walk you through the exact system that transformed Marcus, Sarah, and Jennifer's businesses.

It's called the **Sustainable Growth Framework**, and it has 3 core phases:

**Phase 1: Diagnosis (Week 1-2)**

First, we figure out what's actually broken. Most store owners optimize blindly. We do a deep audit of your customer economics:
- What's your actual LTV vs. CAC ratio?
- What percentage of customers buy again?
- What's your repeat purchase rate vs. industry benchmark?
- Where are you leaving money on the table?

Once we know what's broken, everything becomes clear.

**Phase 2: Restructure (Week 3-8)**

This is where you actually fix it. Depending on what we found, this might include:

✅ Post-purchase sequences that increase repeat purchases 60-90%
✅ Retention/loyalty programs that work (most don't)
✅ Average order value optimization (bundling, upsells)
✅ Email/SMS automation that generates revenue

This isn't glamorous. But it's where the real math changes.

**Phase 3: Optimize (Ongoing)**

Once the system is working, optimization becomes effective. You're not trying to lower CAC against the wind anymore. You're optimizing a working model.

That's where CAC actually decreases—because you're attracting the right customers for your LTV.

---

**Here's the thing:**

Most stores try this alone and hit walls. They don't know the right sequence. They build systems that don't work. They give up.

That's why I created a complete program that walks through all 3 phases with templates, frameworks, and support:

✅ **Diagnostic Framework** — Figure out what's broken
✅ **Implementation Playbook** — Step-by-step phase-by-phase guide
✅ **Email Templates** — Ready-to-use sequences (save 40+ hours)
✅ **Metrics Dashboard** — Track the numbers that matter
✅ **Monthly Strategy Calls** — Support + troubleshooting
✅ **Direct Access** — Slack channel for questions

The investment is **$497/month** or **$4,970/year** (prepay and save $940).

But here's the important part:

**Your first month is risk-free.**

Not "try it and see if you like it" risk-free.

I mean: Implement the diagnostic framework, apply what you learn, measure your results.

If after 30 days you haven't identified at least $8,000 in additional profit opportunity (most find $20k+), full refund. No questions.

Because I'm confident that once you understand how broken your current system is—and how fixable it is—you're not going to want to go back to guessing.

Ready?

Tomorrow is the final email. I'll show you exactly how to get started.

—[Your Name]

P.S. — The stores that have done this all said the same thing: "This should cost 10x more." But the goal is to get you profitable, not to maximize my revenue. If you scale, I'm happy. If you're stuck, neither of us wins.

---

### EMAIL 4 - STRATEGY NOTES

- **System Breakdown:** Clear 3-phase approach (reduces complexity)

- **CTA:** "Ready?" creates anticipation for final email

---

## EMAIL 5: FINAL PUSH & OFFER
**Subject Line:** "30 days. No risk. See for yourself."
**Preview Text:** "Your move, [Name]. Here's how..."
**Send Time:** Day 7 (final decision point)
**Goal:** Open rate 45-50%, final CTA, overcome last objections

---

### EMAIL 5 - FULL COPY

**From:** [Your Name]
**Subject:** 30 days. No risk. See for yourself.
**Preview:** Your move. Here's exactly how to get started.

---

Hi [Name],

This is the last email I'm sending you about this.

Not because the offer isn't good. But because at this point, the decision is clear:

Either you continue the current path (CAC rising, margins declining, growth unsustainable).

Or you try something different.

There's no third option.

You already know the problem isn't your skills or your team. You know it's the model.

You've seen the proof (Marcus, Sarah, Jennifer).

You understand the framework.

You know the guarantee is real (30 days, $8k improvement, full refund if not).

So here's what happens next:

**Step 1: Schedule a strategy call**

We do a 15-minute diagnostic where I review your numbers and show you exactly what's broken in your model.

You'll know:
- Your CAC-to-LTV ratio
- What your repeat purchase rate should be
- Exactly where you're leaving money on the table
- One specific action you can take immediately

This call is free. No pitch. Just real talk about your numbers.

**Step 2: Join the program (if it makes sense)**

You get the full framework, templates, playbook, and support. You implement Phase 1 (diagnosis) immediately. Start Phase 2 within 2 weeks.

**Step 3: Measure and track**

30 days later, you measure the results. If you haven't found at least $8k in profit opportunity, you get your money back.

**Step 4: Scale sustainably**

You go from "how do I survive this quarter?" to "how do I sustainably grow?"

---

**The investment:** $497/month or $4,970/year (annual saves $940)

**The guarantee:** 30 days, $8k improvement, full refund if not

**The risk:** Almost zero. I'm risking my time. You're not risking your money.

---

This offer closes in 3 days.

Not because of scarcity. But because I only work with 8-10 stores per year (I want to actually support people, not just sell programs).

So if this resonates, book your call now.

If you have questions first, just reply to this email. I read every one.
