2. **Build** trust and credibility throughout sequence
3. **Agitate** pain points progressively
4. **Address** objections before Jamie has them
5. **Close** with clear CTA and risk-reversal offer

## ORCHESTRATION SPECIFICS

### Full Agent Workflow
This test will use ALL 14 agents:

1. **Copy Commander** receives brief and routes appropriately
2. **Research Agent** verifies Jamie persona accuracy and gathers context
3. **Headlines/Hooks Specialist** generates 5-7 subject line options for each email
4. **Email Sub-Commander** (new) orchestrates email sequence workflow
5. **Email Copy Writer** (new) generates 5-email sequence
6. **4 Skill-Based Reviewers** evaluate in parallel:
   - Tone & Voice Guardian
   - Psychology & Persuasion Reviewer
   - Entertainment & Engagement Reviewer
   - Audience Fit Guardian
7. **Swipe File Agent** retrieves relevant reference material

### Success Criteria for Orchestration
- All agents execute without errors
- Quality maintained or improved vs. individual tests
- Process completes in <2 hours
- Headlines/Hooks integration improves subject line quality
- Final approval score 9.0+ (matching or exceeding other briefs)

## EMAIL SEQUENCE STRUCTURE

### Overall Strategy
- **Email 1 (Day 0):** Hook + curiosity gap + credibility
- **Email 2 (Day 2):** Problem validation + deeper pain agitation
- **Email 3 (Day 4):** Social proof + case studies + objection handling
- **Email 4 (Day 5):** Solution deep dive + risk reversal
- **Email 5 (Day 7):** Final CTA + scarcity/urgency + guarantee

### Email Length Guidelines
- Subject line: <50 characters (mobile-optimized)
- Preview text: 100-120 characters
- Email body: 200-400 words (scannable)
- CTA: 1-2 clear actions per email

### Success Metrics
- Subject line quality (from Headlines/Hooks): 9+/10
- Open rate prediction: 25-35%
- Click-through prediction: 8-12%
- Conversion prediction: 2-4%

## REFERENCE MATERIALS

### Frameworks to Consider
- **PAS** (Problem-Agitate-Solution) - classic email structure
- **AIDA** (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action) - per-email pacing
- **Storytelling** (vulnerability + transformation)
- **Curiosity loops** (open-to-email-3 for full reveal)

### Tone Requirements
- Peer-to-peer (Jamie doesn't know you yet)
- Progressively more confident (build authority)
- Vulnerable where appropriate (show you understand struggle)
- Direct CTAs (not wishy-washy)
