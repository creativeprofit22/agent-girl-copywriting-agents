# Quality Checklists & Evaluation Framework

**7-Point Quality System Used Throughout All Agents**

---

## The 7-Point Quality Framework

Every copywriting output is evaluated against these 7 criteria. This framework maintains 9.1+/10 quality throughout all agents.

---

## 1. SPECIFICITY (0-10)

**What it measures**: Concrete details vs vague abstractions

**Why it matters**: Vague claims feel like lies. Specificity builds credibility.

### Evaluation Scale

**0-2: Vague and abstract**
```
❌ "Improve your skills"
❌ "Better results"
❌ "Works great"
```

**3-5: Some details but not enough**
```
⚠️ "Save time on your projects"
⚠️ "Increase productivity"
⚠️ "Better collaboration tools"
```

**6-7: Good details but could be more specific**
```
✅ "Save 5 hours per week on project meetings"
✅ "Increase productivity by managing async communication"
✅ "Collaboration tool built for distributed teams"
```

**8-9: Highly specific with numbers and examples**
```
✅✅ "Save 10 hours per week replacing daily standups with async updates"
✅✅ "Increase team productivity 23% through single-threaded communication"
✅✅ "Built for 10-50 person engineering teams across 4+ timezones"
```

**10: Extremely specific with research-backed numbers**
```
✅✅✅ "Engineering teams average 12 hours/week in meetings. This eliminates 80% of them."
✅✅✅ "$50k/year per employee lost to meeting overhead. Here's how to reclaim it."
✅✅✅ "Tested with 500+ companies. 98% reduced meeting time by 10+ hours/week."
```

### Checklist

- [ ] Specific numbers provided (not generic adjectives)
- [ ] Concrete examples given (not abstract concepts)
- [ ] Details are relevant to claim being made
- [ ] Claims backed by specifics (not just asserted)
- [ ] Numbers are credible (not exaggerated)

### Common Mistakes

```
❌ "Significantly improve" → ✅ "Improve by 40%"
❌ "Many customers love it" → ✅ "500+ teams use it"
❌ "Easy to use" → ✅ "Learn in under 30 minutes"
❌ "Better performance" → ✅ "50% faster load times"
```

---

## 2. AUTHENTICITY (0-10)

**What it measures**: Natural voice vs corporate jargon

**Why it matters**: Authentic voice builds trust. Corporate speak feels manipulative.

### Evaluation Scale

**0-2: Sounds like corporate robot**
```
❌ "Maximize your potential synergies"
❌ "Leverage our solutions to optimize outcomes"
❌ "Elevate your value proposition"
```

**3-5: Somewhat natural but has corporate moments**
```
⚠️ "We empower you to achieve your business goals"
⚠️ "Our solution provides unparalleled value"
⚠️ "Unlock your true potential with our platform"
```

**6-7: Mostly natural with some awkward phrasing**
```
✅ "You're spending way too much time in meetings. Here's how to fix it."
✅ "Most copywriters compete on price. The smart ones compete on positioning."
✅ "If this sounds like your situation, keep reading."
```

**8-9: Natural conversational tone**
```
✅✅ "Tired of explaining your value to clients who just want it cheaper?"
✅✅ "You know your copywriting is good. So why aren't you getting paid like it?"
✅✅ "Imagine never having to sit through another status meeting again."
```

**10: Sounds like a real person you want to listen to**
```
✅✅✅ "I used to charge $500 per project. Exact same work. Now I charge $5k."
✅✅✅ "Here's what I noticed: the expensive copywriters don't work harder. They work smarter."
✅✅✅ "And if you're thinking 'but how?'—you're asking the right question."
```

### Checklist

- [ ] Conversational tone (sounds like human speech)
- [ ] No corporate jargon (avoid business buzzwords)
- [ ] Natural pacing (short sentences mixed with longer ones)
- [ ] Personal pronouns used (I, you, we)
- [ ] Contractions present (can't, won't, shouldn't vs cannot, will not)
- [ ] Addresses reader directly ("you" not "the customer")
- [ ] Feels like advice from friend, not pitch from salesman

### Common Mistakes

```
❌ "maximize" → ✅ "get the most out of"
❌ "leverage" → ✅ "use"
❌ "paradigm shift" → ✅ "changing how you think"
❌ "holistic solution" → ✅ "covers everything"
❌ "best-in-class" → ✅ "the best"
❌ "take it to the next level" → ✅ "step up"
```

---

## 3. CLARITY (0-10)

**What it measures**: Easy to understand vs confusing

**Why it matters**: Confused readers don't take action. Clear message = clear results.

### Evaluation Scale

**0-2: Very confusing**
```
❌ "Synergistic methodologies to optimize stakeholder engagement matrices"
❌ "Cognitive dissonance reduction through phenomenological recontextualization"
```

**3-5: Some confusion, unclear main point**
```
⚠️ "By implementing integrated communication protocols, team members can experience enhanced collaborative outcomes"
⚠️ "The intersection of positioning strategy and market differentiation creates value"
```

**6-7: Clear but could be clearer**
```
✅ "We help copywriters charge more by teaching positioning instead of pricing"
✅ "This is for managers whose teams feel scattered and unproductive"
```

**8-9: Very clear, main point obvious**
```
✅✅ "You know your copywriting is good. The problem is: clients don't see it."
✅✅ "We fix that by teaching you to position yourself as a strategist, not just a writer."
```

**10: Crystal clear, couldn't be misunderstood**
```
✅✅✅ "This solves your biggest problem: explaining why you're not the cheapest option."
✅✅✅ "Here's what clients actually buy: results, not work. Learn to sell results."
```

### Checklist

- [ ] Main point stated clearly (reader knows what this is about)
- [ ] Jargon avoided or explained
- [ ] Sentence structure simple (not too many clauses)
- [ ] One idea per sentence
- [ ] Flow is logical (doesn't jump around)
- [ ] Anyone could understand (even someone new to industry)
- [ ] Rereading not necessary (gets it on first read)

### Common Mistakes

```
❌ "Facilitate optimal team dynamics through asynchronous communication strategies"
✅ "Replace meetings with written updates. Your team gets more done, works better hours."

❌ "Our algorithm uses machine learning to optimize engagement"
✅ "We show your best content to people who'll actually care about it"

❌ "The cognitive load reduction resulting from streamlined workflows"
✅ "Less confusion. More focus."
```

## 4. ALIGNMENT (0-10)

**What it measures**: Speaking to target audience's actual pain/desire

**Why it matters**: Misaligned copy gets ignored. Aligned copy gets action.

### Evaluation Scale

**0-2: Completely misaligned**
```
❌ Selling expensive tools to budget-conscious startups
❌ Talking about B2C benefits to B2B decision makers
❌ Addressing wrong pain point
```

**3-5: Partially aligned, misses key elements**
```
⚠️ "This helps with efficiency" (generic—doesn't address their specific pain)
⚠️ "Great for any business" (too broad—not speaking to their situation)
```

**6-7: Good alignment with some generic parts**
```
✅ "For managers: Your remote team stays connected" (good, but could be more specific)
✅ "Saves your engineering team time" (on brand, could specify which kind of time)
```

**8-9: Strongly aligned with target audience**
```
✅✅ "You: An engineering lead managing distributed team. Them: Drowning in async context."
✅✅ "This is specifically for freelance copywriters stuck competing on price."
```

**10: Perfectly aligned, could only apply to this audience**
```
✅✅✅ "For the 10-50 person teams scaling fast: You need more time back. This is how."
✅✅✅ "If you're a copywriter earning $3-5k/project thinking about $10k+, read this."
```

### Checklist

- [ ] Target audience clearly identified
- [ ] Specific pain point named (not generic)
- [ ] Solution directly addresses their pain
- [ ] Desired outcome matches their goals
- [ ] Language reflects their situation
- [ ] Could not equally apply to other audiences
- [ ] Feels like "they wrote this for me" energy

### Common Mistakes

```
❌ "Helps businesses" → ✅ "Helps engineering teams grow without adding headcount"
❌ "Anyone who wants to improve" → ✅ "For freelancers ready to stop competing on price"
❌ "Better productivity" → ✅ "Gets your leadership 10 hours back per week"
❌ "Save money" → ✅ "Eliminate $600k/year in unproductive meeting time"
```

---

## 5. IMPACT (0-10)

**What it measures**: Does it create action/attention/desire?

**Why it matters**: Impact is the ultimate measure. Does copy actually move people?

### Evaluation Scale

**0-2: No impact, boring**
```
❌ "Here's a tool that exists"
❌ "We offer services"
❌ "Learn more about our company"
```

**3-5: Some interest but weak**
```
⚠️ "Try our product, you might like it"
⚠️ "We think you'd benefit from this"
⚠️ "Interested? Contact us"
```

**6-7: Good impact, some action potential**
```
✅ "Most copywriters do this wrong. Here's the better way."
✅ "You're leaving money on the table. Here's how much."
```

**8-9: Strong impact, clear desire to keep reading/watching**
```
✅✅ "The $3k copywriter and the $30k copywriter write almost identical stuff. So why does one earn 10x more?"
✅✅ "What you don't know about positioning is costing you thousands per month."
```

**10: Magnetic impact, impossible to ignore**
```
✅✅✅ "You're not a cheap copywriter. You're an underpriced strategist."
✅✅✅ "Everyone thinks it's a pricing problem. It's never a pricing problem."
```

### Checklist

- [ ] Grabs attention in first few words
- [ ] Creates curiosity or desire to know more
- [ ] Makes reader think/feel something
- [ ] Implies a problem that needs solving
- [ ] Suggests possibility of solution
- [ ] Moves reader to next step (keep reading, respond, etc.)
- [ ] Would stop scroll if on social media

### Common Mistakes

```
❌ "We have a course" → ✅ "The positioning shift that lets freelancers 3x their rates"
❌ "Read our article" → ✅ "What top copywriters know that $3k copywriters don't"
❌ "Learn more" → ✅ "See exactly how positioning changes everything"
```

---

## 6. ORIGINALITY (0-10)

**What it measures**: Novel angle vs obvious/repeated

**Why it matters**: Original stands out. Obvious gets ignored.

### Evaluation Scale

**0-2: Completely unoriginal**
```
❌ "Join thousands of satisfied customers"
❌ "We're the best in the industry"
❌ "Contact us for more info"
```

**3-5: Familiar angle, nothing new**
```
⚠️ "Save time and money"
⚠️ "Improve your productivity"
⚠️ "We're here to help"
```

**6-7: Some original angle but predictable**
```
✅ "Most copywriters compete on price. We teach positioning instead."
✅ "The real difference isn't in the work—it's in the positioning."
```

**8-9: Fresh angle that stands out**
```
✅✅ "You're not a cheap copywriter. You're an underpriced strategist."
✅✅ "Positioning isn't about your work. It's about your client's perception."
```

**10: Completely novel perspective**
```
✅✅✅ "The $30k copywriter isn't working harder. They're working smarter. And it has nothing to do with skill."
✅✅✅ "Your real problem isn't your copy quality. It's that you're selling to the wrong people."
```

### Checklist

- [ ] Not something everyone says
- [ ] Different angle than competitors
- [ ] Fresh perspective on the problem
- [ ] Unexpected insight
- [ ] Not a tired cliché
- [ ] Makes reader think differently
- [ ] Memorable phrasing (not formulaic)

### Common Mistakes

```
❌ "Work smarter, not harder" → ✅ "The $50k copywriters charge different, not better"
❌ "Think outside the box" → ✅ "Most copywriters never question their own pricing"
❌ "Transform your business" → ✅ "Your positioning is more valuable than your copy"
```

## 7. COMPLETENESS (0-10)

**What it measures**: Delivers what was promised vs leaves you hanging

**Why it matters**: Complete message = complete satisfaction. Incomplete = frustration.

### Evaluation Scale

**0-2: Way too incomplete**
```
❌ "Here's a problem..."
❌ "You should probably..."
❌ "There's a better way, but..."
```

**3-5: Partial answer, leaves questions**
```
⚠️ "Positioning matters. You should learn about it."
⚠️ "Your copywriting could be better. Here's why."
```

**6-7: Mostly complete, some gaps**
```
✅ "Positioning matters more than pricing. You can learn it here."
✅ "Your problem is positioning. Try this approach."
```

**8-9: Complete, delivers fully on promise**
```
✅✅ "Your problem: competing on price. The solution: position as strategist instead of writer. Here's exactly how."
✅✅ "What top copywriters know: they sell outcomes, not deliverables. Learn how to make this shift."
```

**10: Over-complete, everything answered**
```
✅✅✅ "Problem: You charge $3k because you haven't positioned yourself. Solution: Reposition as strategist. Why it works: Clients buy transformation, not writing. Here's step-by-step how to implement."
✅✅✅ "The shift: Instead of 'I write copy,' say 'I increase conversions 23%.' Why this works: Outcome-based positioning changes client perception. You become premium automatically."
```

### Checklist

- [ ] Promise made early is fulfilled
- [ ] All logical questions answered
- [ ] Call to action is clear
- [ ] Next step is obvious
- [ ] Doesn't leave reader confused
- [ ] Follows "setup, tension, resolution" pattern
- [ ] Reader feels satisfied (not wanting more)

### Common Mistakes

```
❌ "Positioning is important..." → ✅ "Positioning is important because clients don't see value in your work. Here's how to fix that."

❌ "You should learn this" → ✅ "You should learn this because the shift from 'I write copy' to 'I increase conversions' is worth $30k/year in pricing power."

❌ "There's a better way" → ✅ "There's a better way: stop competing on price. Start competing on positioning. Here's exactly how to make that transition."
```

## Calculating Overall Quality Score

**Formula**: Sum of all 7 scores ÷ 7 = Overall Quality Score

### Example

```
Copy: "The $3k copywriter and the $30k copywriter write the same stuff.
So why does one get paid 10x more?"

Specificity: 9/10 (specific numbers)
Authenticity: 9/10 (natural voice)
Clarity: 9/10 (immediately clear)
Alignment: 9/10 (speaks to copywriters)
Impact: 9/10 (stops scroll)
Originality: 9/10 (fresh angle)
Completeness: 8/10 (answer implied but not explicit)

Total: (9+9+9+9+9+9+8) ÷ 7 = 62 ÷ 7 = 8.9/10

Status: ✅ PASS (8.5+/10 threshold)
```

---

## Quality Thresholds

### By Use Case

**Social Media Post**: 8.0+/10 minimum
**Headline/Hook**: 8.5+/10 minimum
**Email Copy**: 8.5+/10 minimum
**Sales Page**: 9.0+/10 minimum
**Video Script**: 8.5+/10 minimum
**Course Material**: 9.0+/10 minimum

### Production Decision

- **9.0-10.0**: Use as-is, ready for public
- **8.5-8.9**: Good, minor polish optional
- **8.0-8.4**: Acceptable, could improve
- **7.0-7.9**: Needs revision
- **Below 7.0**: Not ready for production

---

## Scoring Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Specificity, Low Authenticity

**Copy**: "Increase your conversion rates by 47% using our proprietary algorithm methodology"

Scores:
- Specificity: 9/10 (exact number)
- Authenticity: 3/10 (sounds like corporate robot)
- Clarity: 7/10 (clear but jargony)
- Alignment: 6/10 (generic)
- Impact: 5/10 (not compelling)
- Originality: 3/10 (common claim)
- Completeness: 4/10 (doesn't explain why)

**Average: 5.3/10** ❌ Needs significant revision

**Fix**: "Your pages are converting at 2.3%. Our customers average 3.4%. Here's why—and how to make the shift."

### Scenario 2: High Authenticity, Low Specificity

**Copy**: "You know your writing is good. You just need to believe in yourself more and the right clients will find you."

Scores:
- Specificity: 2/10 (no numbers, abstract)
- Authenticity: 9/10 (conversational, real)
- Clarity: 8/10 (clear message)
- Alignment: 7/10 (speaks to copywriters)
- Impact: 6/10 (somewhat motivating)
- Originality: 4/10 (common message)
- Completeness: 5/10 (missing action)

**Average: 5.9/10** ❌ Needs revision

**Fix**: "You know your writing is good. The problem: clients don't see it. Here's why—and the one positioning shift that changes their perception."

### Scenario 3: Balanced but Missing Impact

**Copy**: "We teach positioning strategies that help freelance copywriters increase their project rates from $3k to $10k. For writers ready to grow."

Scores:
- Specificity: 8/10 (specific numbers)
- Authenticity: 7/10 (conversational)
- Clarity: 8/10 (clear)
- Alignment: 9/10 (for copywriters)
- Impact: 5/10 (boring)
- Originality: 4/10 (predictable)
- Completeness: 8/10 (complete message)

**Average: 7.0/10** ⚠️ Needs punch

**Fix**: "Your copywriting is good. So why does the cheap copywriter get the same clients? Because you're competing on price instead of positioning. Here's the shift that changes everything."
