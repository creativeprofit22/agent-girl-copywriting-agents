# Core Copywriting Frameworks
## Master Formulas for High-Converting Copy

---

## 1. PROBLEM-AGITATE-SOLUTION (PAS)
**Origin:** Dan Kennedy / Direct Response Tradition
**Best for:** Sales pages, email, landing pages, ads

### Structure:
1. **PROBLEM** - Define prospect's problem clearly
2. **AGITATE** - Amplify the emotional weight, consequences, urgency
3. **SOLUTION** - Introduce your answer

### Example:
"[PROBLEM] You're still charging $5k per project despite 5 years of experience.

[AGITATE] Every day you don't fix this, you're leaving $10k on the table. You're watching freelancers with less skill than you charging 5x your rate. It's maddening.

[SOLUTION] But here's what I discovered: skill isn't the bottleneck. Positioning is."

### Key Principle:
People are 2-3x more motivated by pain avoidance than gain. Lead with the problem, agitate it emotionally, THEN solve.

---

## 2. STAR-STORY-SOLUTION (Gary Halbert)
**Origin:** Gary Halbert / Classic Sales Letter
**Best for:** Long-form sales pages, emails, storytelling

### Structure:
1. **STAR** - Attention-grabbing promise or curiosity hook
2. **STORY** - Personal narrative showing struggle → turning point → transformation
3. **SOLUTION** - How to get what the STAR promised

### Example:
"[STAR] I'm about to tell you something that costs freelancers thousands in lost income if they ignore it.

[STORY] I was charging $75/hour like everyone else. Competing. Exhausted. One day, I realized the problem wasn't my writing—it was my positioning...

[SOLUTION] That's when I developed the system. It worked so well I wanted to share it..."

### Key Principle:
Stories stick. Facts are forgotten. Use narrative to build emotional connection BEFORE selling.

---

## 3. AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
**Origin:** Classic Advertising Framework
**Best for:** Structured sales sequences, headlines, ads

### Structure:
1. **ATTENTION** - Grab with headline/hook
2. **INTEREST** - Deepen by addressing their situation
3. **DESIRE** - Build emotional connection and prove solution works
4. **ACTION** - Clear CTA with urgency

### Example:
"[ATTENTION] From Struggling Freelancer To $10k Project Getter

[INTEREST] You've been doing great work for 3 years but rates haven't moved. Frustrating, right?

[DESIRE] Here's how others fixed this. Sarah went from $5k to $15k in 60 days. Kiril books 3-5 calls daily...

[ACTION] Apply now (spots limited, filling fast)"

### Key Principle:
Structured progression moves prospect from awareness to action naturally.

---

## 4. THE FOUR Ps (Promise-Picture-Proof-Push)
**Origin:** Eugene Schwartz / Advanced Copywriting
**Best for:** Sales pages, email sequences, ads

### Structure:
1. **PROMISE** - What they get (benefit-focused)
2. **PICTURE** - Show life after solution (paint the dream)
3. **PROOF** - Evidence it works (testimonials, data, examples)
4. **PUSH** - CTA with urgency/friction removal

### Example:
"[PROMISE] Command premium rates without losing clients

[PICTURE] Imagine working with 3-4 perfect clients instead of 10+ mediocre ones. You earn more, work less, have time for family...

[PROOF] Sarah did this. Kiril did this. 47 freelancers in our community did this in the last 90 days...

[PUSH] Join them (limited spots, opens Monday only)"

### Key Principle:
Move from rational benefit → emotional vision → logical proof → action.

---

## 5. BEFORE-AFTER-BRIDGE (BAB)
**Origin:** Direct Response Marketing
**Best for:** Headlines, hook lines, email subject lines, ads

### Structure:
1. **BEFORE** - Current painful situation
2. **AFTER** - Desired future state
3. **BRIDGE** - How you get from before to after

### Example:
"Before: Charging $5k per project, competing on price, exhausted.

After: Commanding $15k per project, chosen clients, working 30 hours/week.

Bridge: The positioning shift only 6% of freelancers understand."

### Key Principle:
Creates contrast that makes transformation feel desirable AND believable.

---

## 6. CURIOSITY-AGITATION-RESOLUTION (CAR)
**Origin:** Modern Email Marketing
**Best for:** Email sequences, hook lines, opening lines

### Structure:
1. **CURIOSITY** - Raise a question or gap
2. **AGITATION** - Deepen the emotional tension
3. **RESOLUTION** - Answer the question (which is your offer)

### Example:
"[CURIOSITY] What if your freelance pricing power has nothing to do with skill?

[AGITATION] That's right. You could be the best copywriter in your niche and still charge commodity rates. Because the market doesn't reward skill. It rewards positioning.

[RESOLUTION] Here's how the 6% of freelancers charging premium rates do it..."

### Key Principle:
Curiosity pulls readers forward. Agitation makes them emotionally invested. Resolution satisfies while selling.

---

## 7. IDENTIFY-EMPATHIZE-SHOW-OFFER (IESO)
**Origin:** Persuasion Psychology
**Best for:** Email, social, landing pages (any warm audience)

### Structure:
1. **IDENTIFY** - Show you understand their specific problem
2. **EMPATHIZE** - Validate their feelings about it
3. **SHOW** - Proof others solved it
4. **OFFER** - Your solution

### Example:
"[IDENTIFY] You're a talented copywriter with years of experience, but you're still charging what junior freelancers charge.

[EMPATHIZE] I know how frustrating that is. You've invested years building skill. You should be rewarded for that expertise.

[SHOW] Here's how Sophia, Marcus, and 15 others broke through the rate ceiling...

[OFFER] Here's exactly how you can too..."

### Key Principle:
Validation builds trust. Trust creates openness to solution.

---

## 8. THE HOOK FORMULA (Alternative versions)
**Origin:** Various copywriters / Russell Brunson adaptation

### Hook Option 1: Curiosity Gap
"[Surprising fact/statement that contradicts assumptions]"

Example: "The best-paid freelancers aren't the most talented. Here's why..."

### Hook Option 2: Problem Recognition
"If you [experience X problem], then this is for you"

Example: "If you're earning less than $150/hour despite 5+ years experience, pay attention"

### Hook Option 3: Bold Claim
"[Specific promise of outcome]"

Example: "I'm about to show you how to 3x your rates in 90 days"

### Hook Option 4: Story Opening
"[Personal struggle/admission]"

Example: "I was charging $75/hour and couldn't understand why"

### Hook Option 5: Question
"[Thought-provoking question]"

Example: "What if pricing power has nothing to do with skill?"

### Key Principle:
Best hooks either create curiosity gap, validate current pain, or promise surprising benefit.

---

## 9. OBJECTION-FIRST FRAMEWORK
**Origin:** Advanced Sales Training
**Best for:** Addressing hesitation, building trust, email sequences

### Structure:
1. **ACKNOWLEDGE** - Name the objection directly
2. **VALIDATE** - Show it's legitimate concern
3. **EXPLAIN** - Why it's actually not a blocker
4. **PROVE** - Evidence overcoming this objection
5. **RESOLVE** - Clear solution

### Example:
"[ACKNOWLEDGE] You're probably thinking: 'I'll raise rates and lose all my clients.'

[VALIDATE] That's a real concern. You have bills to pay. You can't afford to experiment.

[EXPLAIN] But here's what actually happens: You don't raise rates across the board. You raise with new prospects. Existing clients stay grandfathered.

[PROVE] Sarah kept all her existing clients, raised rates with new ones, and now 80% of her new clients pay 3x her old rate.

[RESOLVE] So you're not risking your income. You're securing your future."

### Key Principle:
Directly addressing objections builds more trust than ignoring them.

## 10. THE STORYTELLING STRUCTURE
**Origin:** Classic Narrative / Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey
**Best for:** Building credibility, case studies, long-form content

### Structure:
1. **SETUP** - Show the normal world (before)
2. **INCITING INCIDENT** - Problem arises / recognition moment
3. **STRUGGLE** - Journey through challenge
4. **TURNING POINT** - The key realization/decision
5. **TRANSFORMATION** - New approach/action
6. **RESOLUTION** - Results and new normal
7. **WISDOM** - What was learned (teachable moment)

### Example:
"[SETUP] I was a freelancer charging $75/hour, competing with everyone.

[INCITING INCIDENT] One day, a client refused to pay $75 and offered $50. I realized I was in a race to the bottom.

[STRUGGLE] I tried improving my writing. Didn't help. Tried different platforms. Didn't help.

[TURNING POINT] Then I realized: it's not about writing skill. It's about positioning.

[TRANSFORMATION] I stopped competing on price. Started positioning as strategist.

[RESOLUTION] Now I charge $15k per project and turn down work.

[WISDOM] Here's exactly how to do what I did..."

### Key Principle:
Stories are 22x more memorable than facts. Use narrative structure for maximum retention and belief.

---

## 11. THE BRIDGE FRAMEWORK
**Origin:** Ramit Sethi / Behavioral Economics
**Best for:** Shifting beliefs, reframing problems, overcoming limiting beliefs

### Structure:
1. **OLD BELIEF** - What prospect currently believes (usually limiting)
2. **REALITY CHECK** - Why that belief is wrong/outdated
3. **NEW BELIEF** - What they should believe instead
4. **PROOF** - Evidence supporting new belief
5. **ACTION** - What to do now

### Example:
"[OLD BELIEF] You think pricing power comes from being a better writer.

[REALITY CHECK] But top-paid freelancers aren't always the best writers. Some are mediocre at writing but excellent at positioning.

[NEW BELIEF] Pricing power actually comes from how you position yourself in the market.

[PROOF] Look at Sarah. Her writing is good, not exceptional. But she positioned as 'conversion specialist,' not 'copywriter.' Now she charges 5x.

[ACTION] Here's how to shift your positioning..."

### Key Principle:
Shifting beliefs is more powerful than adding information.
